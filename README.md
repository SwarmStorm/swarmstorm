## Professional Expertise

### Integrating Complex Systems

My expertise in **systems integration** has enabled me to seamlessly connect disparate platforms, ensuring efficient data flow and communication. I've worked extensively in **Healthcare EMRs**, helping build features and contributing to passing the **G measures in ONC CQM testing**. I've also integrated systems like **POPHEALTH** to EMR software. Additionally, I've had the privilege to:

- **Develop Billing Systems**: Leading projects for Fortune 100 companies like **Staples**, **Dish Network**, and **Comcast**, I developed robust billing systems that handle millions of transactions securely and efficiently.
- **Work with Health Information Exchanges**: In the healthcare sector, I integrated complex systems such as **Health Information Exchanges (HIEs)** utilizing **FHIR**, facilitating secure and compliant data sharing among healthcare providers.
- **Connect to State Vaccination Systems**: I played a crucial role in linking medical facilities with state vaccination registries, improving public health monitoring and response.
- **Work with Laboratory Systems**: I've connected with Labcorp, Quest Diagnostics, and many others processing data bidirectionally with their systems.

### Building Innovative Products

I'm passionate about transforming ideas into reality, building products from concept to large-scale deployment:

- **Telehealth Platform Development**: At the onset of **COVID-19**, I developed a comprehensive **Telehealth platform** from scratch. This platform enabled thousands of providers to deliver critical psychological services remotely, bridging the gap in mental health care during a global crisis.
- **Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS)**: Created an iPaaS solution that empowers users to build integrations on their own, reducing reliance on specialized development teams and accelerating business processes.
- **AI-Driven Maintenance Solutions**: Currently, I'm behind a patent-pending product in the **Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS)** space. This innovative solution leverages **Artificial Intelligence** and cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize how maintenance technicians keep the world running.

## Technical Proficiency

- **Programming Languages**: Proficient in **JavaScript**, **Python**, and a comfortable polyglot in many others.
- **Frameworks**: Experienced with **React**, **Angular**, **Node.js**, **.NET**, and **Ruby on Rails**.
- **Databases**: Skilled in **MSSQL**, **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, and data warehousing technologies.
- **DevOps and Cloud**: Expertise in **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **AWS**, **Serverless**, **Azure**, **Github CICD**, and **Google Cloud Platform**.
- **APIs and Microservices**: Designed and implemented scalable **APIs** and **microservices** architectures for high-traffic applications.
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Applied **Machine Learning** algorithms and AI technologies to enhance product features and user experiences. I've also **built from scratch models**, and **created novel DAG** pipelines.
